Hello, welcome to my page! My name is Nikon Sugar. I am a curious person who always want to know how things work and love to learn and build new things. I am currently focusing on building things with AI for healthcare professionals. 

This site is mainly for myself as personal notes so that I can keep things in one place for easy access in the long term as I am tired of server maintenance. You might quickly find it's boring due to unrelevant things but I am very glad if you can find something fun here while browsing. 

So happy clicking and scrolling around. Enjoy!
